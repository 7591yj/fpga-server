      This is the onboard page of <a href="/">FPGA.S</a>, an integrated FPGA job
      management interface.
      <br>
      Use this panel to monitor device activity, manage job
      submissions, and review results from completed tasks.
    </p>
    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/stat">Stat</a>: Inspect the current FPGA device status,
        active workloads, and queued jobs in real time. Useful for verifying
        resource availability before adding new tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/queue">Queue</a>: Configure and submit new jobs. Specify device
        targets, bitstreams, and runtime parameters. Queue entries will be
        processed sequentially(FIFO) according to availability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/result">Result</a>: Retrieve logs and output data for completed
        jobs. Each record includes timestamps, resource metrics, and compilation
        or deployment summaries.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Select your device at the right top of the navbar. If there is no device listed, or if the desired device is not
      present, please click the 'refresh' button next to it.
      If you still do not see the device even after refreshing, please contact the administrator through <a>here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After selecting the device, all menus will be shown according to the device. Note that only the information for
      the selected device is shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to check ALL the job result no matter the device, please go ahead and click the 'show all' button
      on the right top side of the result page.
      Please do note that for other pages except for the result page, showing all devices are NOT SUPPORTED by design.
